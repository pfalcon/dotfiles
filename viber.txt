sudo nano /usr/share/applications/viber.desktop

Exec=/opt/viber/Viber %u

to

Exec=bash -c "QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1.3 /opt/viber/Viber %u"


Doesn't seem to work with latest Viber, but there's a better solution which
scales just fonts:

QT_FONT_DPI=120 /opt/viber/Viber

See also viber.sh

Problem: After packages upgrades (apparently, Qt-related), Viber starts with
completely white window.

Solution (from https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2412294):

rm -rf ~/.cache/qtshadercache
